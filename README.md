# AsteroidsGameApplet

Recreated asteroids game applet project from high school  
Note that java applet is deprecated from java 11 and up  
Recreated and ran using Netbeans 8.2 with Java platform JDK 1.8.0_181 (which somehow still has the applet library working in it)
  
Since applet is depricated, I will not continue working on this. Completing the original instruction packet for this project had a few flaws:  
- No bounds for ship
  - Fixed although since ship is a polygon, it streaches out due to recaluting points for polygon at on/close to boundaries 
- Shotting mechanic is poorly functional or not at all
  - Not going to waste time fixing it (applet deprecated)
